# -Analysis-with-SQL-and-Tableau-Project
Earning a career certificate is challenging, requiring students to pass nine course exams (seven compulsory and two elective courses) and a comprehensive exam covering all required courses.


In this project, I analyze student enrollments and achievements in various career tracks introduced in a 2021 platform release. These tracks are designed to prepare students for roles such as data scientist, data analyst, or business analyst.

Earning a career certificate is challenging, requiring students to pass nine course exams (seven compulsory and two elective courses) and a comprehensive exam covering all required courses.

My task involves extracting relevant data from an SQL database and using Tableau to visualize and interpret the findings related to career track enrollments and completions.

Project Requirements

I will work with MySQL Workbench 8.0 and Tableau 2022 or newer for this project.
